a bit about myself: I live in Honolulu but I'm from Lanai.  I have a BA in English Literature but want to be a data analysit.  Truly, I would like to be an inteligence analyst for the CIA or DIA but I don't have the back ground for that eather.  
Skills I am working on include coding in Python, postgreSQL,and node.js.
